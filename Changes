Revision history for Perl extension Apache2::Filter::Minifier::CSS.

1.03    Fri Sep 28 11:09 PDT 2007
    - rewrote Build.PL/Makefile.PL so they now check if you've got Apache::Test
      installed -at-configuration-time-.  if not, the build is abortted.  One
      day, CPAN(PLUS) et al. will support "configure_requires", but until then
      we've got to check for this ourselves.
    - fixed Content-Type filtering so that it now properly handles HTTP headers
      that have additional attributes (e.g. "charset=...")

1.02    Tue Sep 25 23:33 PDT 2007
    - added Makefile.PL, so CPANPLUS testers stop failing tests because they
      don't have Module::Build installed

1.01    Fri Sep 21 13:39 PDT 2007
    - added explicit dependency on MP2
    - updated test requirements to "need_*" instead of "have_*"

1.00    Thu Sep 20 16:47 PDT 2007
    - initial version
